                Problem: Watch an animated film and write about examles of three principles of animation. Share video clips or screenshots of the example in context.

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                I chose to watch the film <strong>The Thief and the Cobbler</strong>. Richard Williams is my favorite animator, and I personally marvel at the virtuosity in this film. Rather than point out 3 different principles of animation from various parts of the film, I thought it would be a fun exercise to breakdown and identify all 12 principles from a single scene. Here's the 20 second clip I chose to dissect:

                        <strong>Solid drawing:</strong> This clip was traditionally animated, and yet we can still see skillfully it was made. All movement feels believable. There's no twinning in any of the poses or movement. The character's anatomy is on point, except for when they are "deformed" to improve fluidity. We can see a foreshortening effect as he moves his hands closer and further away from us. Oh, and he has 6 fingers on each hand, plus an extra joint on each finger (bet you didn't catch that one!), but it's so skillfully animated that we don't percieve it. Solid drawing!<br />

                I began the process by creating UV layouts for the pumpkin, Snoopy, and Woodstock. This allowed me to use Photoshop to paint color maps. I tried to replicate the grime and degradation from the actual object (It’s about 15 years old). I used 3 point lighting to light the scene. I used a directional light for the key light, a point light for fill, and an area light for the rim light. I played around with the lights individually to get decent lighting. I then proceeded to add bump maps to the surfaces. I used Maya mountain textures for Woodstock, and created my own bump maps for the other objects based on their color maps. For the base surface, I used another mountain texture for diffuse and bump maps. I used Nuke to run the image sequence and create the ping-pong playback.

                For both of the objects, I started out by applying an aiStandardShader, and creating 3 point lighting for the scene using a Maya directional light for the key light, and an Arnold area light for the fill and rim lights. For shading the orange, I set the base color and added Brownian noise as a bump map. For Jupiter, I started by creating a ramp node and adding various colors to represent different parts of the planet. I tried to add the vortex by using Maya’s leather texture and combining both in a layer node. I used this as the base color for Jupiter. I then used some wispy noise as a displacement map.

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                To model this shoe, I began by lofting Bezier curves to form the base of the shoe. I beveled the edge to of the top to make it more aesthetically pleasing. I used the extrude tool to form the straps, and the resolve tool to create the heel and the back of the shoe. I finally split my curves into halves and lofted them together to cap the open surfaces.

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                For this exercise, I found a course titled “
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-maya-character-head-modeling-for-beginners/" target="_blank">
                    <strong>Learn Maya - Character Head Modeling for Beginners</strong>
                </a>
                ” on Udemy taught by 3D Character Instructor Nalini Kanta Jena. The 1st two videos covered prepping and setting up reference images on image planes in Maya. The 3rd video went over the anatomy of eyeballs and demonstrated the approach to model them using a combination of 2 different deformed spheres. The 4th video covered the technique to create eyelids by using the Create Polygon Tool and extruding edges. The 5th video went over blocking the basic lip shapes using the same technique as eyelids. The 6th video illustrated modeling the cheek and connecting the mouth to the eyes. The 7th video discussed blocking out the forehead and overall shape of the skull. One useful technique demonstrated was enabling the <strong>Insert with Edge Flow</strong> option in the Insert Edge Loop tool. The 8th went over creating the neck by extruding and rotating edges to create a bust of sorts. The 9th video covered the anatomy and constructing of nostrils, completing the rough model. The 10th video started the next unit which deals with detailing. This video demonstrated how to detail the lips by using appropriately positioned edge loops to both add details and support the existing edges to harden them as required. My biggest take away from this series was the importance of understanding anatomy before beginning a model.

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                We were given a single reference image of a lamp to model. I began the process by creating a bezier curve to draw out the cross section of the lamp. I used the revolve tool to turn this into a NURBS surface, and then went back to the original curve to refine the shape a bit. I repeated this same process for the lamp shade. For the base platform, I created multiplie NURBS squares of different sizes (each representing cross sections of the platform at points where the shape changes), and used the loft functions to build a surface.

                We were given a single reference image of a work table to model.

The biggest difficulty I had was to try and minimize unnecessary support edge loops. This involved working and reworking the model's topology.

I ended up extruding faces to create the indentation of the squeezer, and added edge loops to pull the sharp edges out. Creating the base was a lot easier, and just involved adding edge loops and moving vertices. I then went back and cleaned up the model to make sure I didn't have any ngons or triangles.

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                For this assignment, I decided to stick to spheres (and a torus for Saturn's ring) and use textures to distinguish between the different planets and moons. I found texture maps for these objects from various sources online, and applied them as the color map on lambert shaders. I decided to avoid using manual keyframes for the animation. Instead, I felt that I could save a lot of time by using expressions to control the rotation. I had all the planets and moons grouped in a way that made it easy to add expressions appropriately. All the objects rotate and orbit at unique speeds.
